My long gap without working on this was partly due to discouragement at the thought of the tedium to how I was editing levels - so I finally made more of an effort to seek out a level editor. I found one that looks promising, but want to modify the source code to better suit my needs and work out some issues it has. So today's work was spent on stripping it down a bit, but there remains work to do on that front still.
