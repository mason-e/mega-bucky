# Mega Bucky Devlog 2

It's not exactly a hiatus, but after over a week break, I'm back working on it.

## 2 Aug 2024

The recent news about romhacking.net effectively shutting down was a potential big blow to the project, as I'm now left wondering where I'll host the hack once I'm ready to release it. At least I know that will be a ways off with how much work remains, so hopefully a suitable successor will emerge in that time.

Initially I started out trying to identify every metatile for Green Planet, but then I realized how time consuming this would be. Instead, I ended up deciding to replace pretty much everything but the level ground/platforms. It is much easier to do that and doesn't require as precise knowledge of what each metatile is. I was initially afraid of making metatiles hard to identify for later on, but I realized that it's better to just wipe them out anyway and change background graphics entirely.

Here is what one act of Green Planet looks like with this. I put a moon metatile at the top right of each "screen" to have an easy identifier for where each cutoff is.

That is a lot of screenshots, so as I continue with this going forward, I won't post them for each screen. I also did the same for the second act today.

Continued through Green Planet cleaning up backgrounds. I skipped through some areas, like Act 3, since the tree backgrounds are also closely tied to the platforming. Started into Red Planet. Green Planet Act 5 and the beginning of Red Planet both make things slightly trickier with parallax. 

Also spent some more time trying to plan out more level changes and determine good MM source material for them. Did some reorganizing on how I document these plans.

Changed the waterfall texture and color in Green Planet. See below:

A little bit of corruption and documentation reorganization today as well. Now I'm at a point where I have a lot of the technical know-how to edit level tiles, but choosing the right graphics is the hard part.
